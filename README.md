Readme: Creating Model Folders for ML
Inside your ML directory, create a folder named models. This folder will store all your trained models.

Within the models folder, create two sub-folders:
bert: This sub-folder is designated for saving BERT model artifacts.
lstm: This sub-folder is designated for saving LSTM model artifacts.
